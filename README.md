An automatic merge is when it automatically folds in because each collaborator has done their part right, with spaces in between.
---
A merge conflict happens locally whoever pushes it has no issues whoever tries to push it will recieve an error you must pull before they push. 
Pulling will result in a merge conflict that they must fix.
---
You resolve it by re-adding and committing and pushing.
